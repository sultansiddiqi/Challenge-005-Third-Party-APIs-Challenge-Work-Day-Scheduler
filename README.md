## Project Description
Your Task
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the Moment.js project status page.

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Overview  
* Added 12 slots related to the 12 hours desired. 7am-7pm
* Added a date function that refreshed to have a live clock on the top of the page
* Created a text input slot to enter the desired task
* Added a save button per slot to allow the user to save that task in that hour
* Added a window alert to let them know the button was clicked and the item was saved
* Added a console log as well to allow the user to see if the buttons are responding
* Colour coded (as required) to show current hour time-slot, greyed out passed hours, and green is upcoming hours
